# Flow Metrics Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project provides flow metrics calculation and visualization for Azure DevOps work items, helping teams understand their performance through key metrics like Lead Time, Cycle Time, and Flow Efficiency.

## Architecture Notes
- Environment variables are used to securely store sensitive information like Azure DevOps PAT
- The project uses a shared configuration file at `powershell/config.json` for both Python and PowerShell components
- Configuration structure uses snake_case keys in Python and requires proper nesting (e.g., azure_devops section)
- Batching is necessary when fetching large numbers of work items to avoid URL length limits (max 200 items per request)
- Logging has been implemented to provide visibility into the application's operation and troubleshoot issues
- The Python application successfully connects to Azure DevOps and retrieves work item data
- The dashboard is a standalone HTML file that uses IndexedDB for storage, no server component required
- A batch script (open_dashboard.bat) has been created to streamline the process of refreshing data and opening the dashboard
- All changes should follow proper Git workflow with atomic commits and descriptive messages

## Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

## 🚀 Fast Mock Integration Testing Implementation

### 🎯 **Achievement: Instant Testing Capability**

**Performance Metrics (2025-07-10T14:55:00):**
```
Fast Mock Integration Test Results:
- Data Generation: 0.001 seconds (14 work items)
- Flow Metrics Calculation: 0.002 seconds  
- Total Test Execution: 0.015 seconds
- Memory Usage: Minimal (no network buffers)
- Reliability: 100% (no network dependencies)
```

**Mock Data Quality:**
- Total Items: 14 (realistic for 7-day period)
- Completion Rate: 7.1% (realistic for active development)
- Average Lead Time: 3.0 days (reasonable for small items)
- State Transitions: Proper progression simulation
- Team Assignment: Realistic distribution across assignees

### 🛠️ **Usage Guidelines for Agents**

**For Development & Debugging:**
```bash
# Instant integration test with mock data
python test_fast_mock.py

# Expected output: Completes in < 0.1 seconds
# Generates: dashboard/fast_mock_test_results.json
```

**For Live ADO Integration:**
```bash
# Full integration with real Azure DevOps data
python python/test_ado_integration.py

# Note: Requires AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT environment variable
# Generates: dashboard/ado_integration_test.json  
```

**When to Use Each Approach:**
- **Fast Mock**: Development, debugging, CI/CD, offline work
- **Live ADO**: Production validation, real data analysis, final testing

### 🎆 **Technical Implementation Details**

**FastMockADOClient Class:**
- Inherits from AzureDevOpsClient but overrides get_work_items()
- Generates realistic ADO data structure in memory
- No network calls, no external dependencies
- Configurable data volume (days_back parameter)

**Data Structure Compatibility:**
- Matches exact format expected by FlowMetricsCalculator
- Includes proper state transitions with correct field names
- Realistic assignee distribution and work item types
- Compatible with existing dashboard and reporting systems

### 🔄 Test Status Summary
- **ADO Integration**: FAILED (Unicode encoding)
- **Dashboard Validation**: PASSED
- **Overall Integration**: BLOCKED until encoding issue resolved

### 📋 Current Goal
Resolve Unicode encoding issues to enable full ADO integration testing
