## üîß Integration Points

### Calculator Integration
```python
from src.work_item_type_mapper import create_type_mapper

mapper = create_type_mapper()

# Get types for velocity calculation
velocity_types = mapper.get_velocity_types()
# Returns: ['Task', 'Product Backlog Item', 'Requirement', 'Feature']

# Check if type uses story points
uses_points = mapper.uses_story_points('Product Backlog Item')  
# Returns: True

# Get complexity multiplier
complexity = mapper.get_complexity_multiplier('Feature')
# Returns: 3.0
```

### Metrics System Integration
```python
# Get calculation rules
calc_rules = mapper.get_calculation_rules()

# Velocity calculation
velocity_types = calc_rules['velocity_calculation']['include_types']
exclude_types = calc_rules['velocity_calculation']['exclude_types']

# Throughput calculation  
include_all = calc_rules['throughput_calculation']['include_all_types']
exclude_portfolio = calc_rules['throughput_calculation']['exclude_portfolio_items']
```

### Validation Integration
```python
# Validate work item type
is_valid = validate_work_item_type('Task')  # Returns: True

# Get type category
category = get_type_category('Product Backlog Item')  # Returns: 'Requirements'

# Validate effort estimation
valid_effort = mapper.validate_effort('Product Backlog Item', 8)  # Returns: True (Fibonacci)
```
