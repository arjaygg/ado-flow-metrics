# Live Testing Guide - Advanced Filtering Features

## üöÄ Feature Branch: `feat/ado-flow-live-testing`

This branch contains the implementation of three major features for live testing:

### ‚ú® New Features Available for Testing

1. **Work Item Type Filtering**
   - Multi-select dropdown in both dashboards
   - Filter by: User Story, Bug, Task, Feature, Epic, Issue, Test Case
   - Real-time chart and metrics updates

2. **Sprint-based Filtering**
   - Dynamic sprint selection with auto-population
   - Includes Backlog items
   - Synchronized across all dashboard components

3. **Executive Dashboard Defect Ratio Chart**
   - Interactive pie chart with configurable bug types
   - Flexible denominator selection (All types vs Selected types)
   - Configuration panel for customizing calculations

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Open dashboards directly in browser
open dashboard.html           # Main dashboard
open executive-dashboard.html # Executive dashboard
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# 1. Run validation tests
python3 test_new_features.py

# 2. Test with CLI server (recommended)
python3 -m src.cli serve --port 8000 --open-browser

# 3. Test with different data sources
python3 -m src.cli demo --use-mock-data --open-browser
```

## üìã Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Work Item Type Filtering
- [ ] Open main dashboard
- [ ] Click Work Item Type dropdown
- [ ] Select "Bug" only - verify charts update
- [ ] Select multiple types (Bug + User Story) - verify counts
- [ ] Test "All Types" selection
- [ ] Repeat on executive dashboard

### Scenario 2: Sprint Filtering
- [ ] Open main dashboard
- [ ] Click Sprint dropdown - verify it populates with available sprints
- [ ] Select specific sprint - verify filtering works
- [ ] Select multiple sprints - verify combined results
- [ ] Test "All Sprints" selection
- [ ] Repeat on executive dashboard

### Scenario 3: Defect Ratio Chart (Executive Dashboard)
- [ ] Open executive dashboard
- [ ] Locate defect ratio chart section
- [ ] Test bug type configuration (Bug, Defect, Issue checkboxes)
- [ ] Test denominator options (All Types vs Selected Types)
- [ ] Verify pie chart updates in real-time
- [ ] Check center percentage display
- [ ] Test hover interactions

### Scenario 4: Combined Filtering
- [ ] Apply Work Item Type filter
- [ ] Apply Sprint filter simultaneously
- [ ] Verify both filters work together
- [ ] Check all charts update consistently
- [ ] Test filter reset functionality

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
- Dropdowns populate with data from selected source
- Charts update immediately when filters change
- Percentage calculations are accurate
- UI remains responsive during filtering
- Filter state is preserved when switching between sections

### ‚ùå Issues to Report
- Dropdowns not populating
- Charts not updating after filter selection
- Incorrect calculations in defect ratio
- JavaScript errors in browser console
- UI responsiveness issues
- Filter combinations not working

## üìä Test Data Sources

### Mock Data (Default)
- Pre-populated with realistic test data
- Includes all work item types and sprints
- Consistent data for repeatable testing

### CLI Data
- Real Azure DevOps data (if configured)
- Dynamic sprint and work item type options
- Production-like testing environment

### JSON File Upload
- Custom test datasets
- Specific edge case testing
- Historical data validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If filters don't populate:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify data source selection is correct
3. Refresh the page and try again

### If charts don't update:
1. Check that the data source contains the expected fields
2. Verify browser developer tools for network errors
3. Try switching data sources

### For performance issues:
1. Test with smaller datasets first
2. Check browser memory usage
3. Clear browser cache and refresh

## üìã Validation Checklist

- [ ] 100% test suite pass rate (4/4 tests)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Data consistency across all filter combinations
