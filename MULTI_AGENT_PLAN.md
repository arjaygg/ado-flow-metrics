## Active Tasks

### TASK_003: Azure DevOps Performance Optimization [URGENT]
**Agent**: developer
**Status**: ready
**Priority**: high
**Assigned**: 2025-07-11 01:00:00

**Objective**: Enhance Azure DevOps work item fetching performance and progress visibility

**Current Issues Identified**:
- Slow sequential batch processing in `get_work_items()` method
- Poor progress visibility - only shows spinner with no actual progress
- Verbose logging clutters terminal output
- No indication if process is stuck or running normally
- Sequential HTTP requests create unnecessary delays

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. **Enhanced Progress Indication**:
   - Replace simple spinner with multi-phase progress tracking
   - Show current phase: "Querying work items...", "Fetching batch 1/5...", "Processing state history..."
   - Display item counts and completion percentages
   - Add estimated time remaining based on current rate

2. **Concurrent Batch Processing**:
   - Implement concurrent HTTP requests for batch work item details
   - Use ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio for parallel API calls
   - Respect Azure DevOps API rate limits (suggested: 5-10 concurrent requests max)
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **Progress Callback System**:
   - Add progress callback parameter to `get_work_items()` method
   - Implement callback interface for CLI progress updates
   - Support both CLI Rich progress bars and programmatic progress tracking

4. **Reduced Terminal Verbosity**:
   - Move verbose logging to debug level only
   - Keep only essential user-facing progress messages
   - Consolidate batch processing logs into single progress updates

**Technical Implementation Plan**:

```python
# Enhanced method signature
def get_work_items(self, days_back: int = 90, progress_callback=None) -> List[Dict]:
    # Phase 1: Query work item IDs
    if progress_callback:
        progress_callback("phase", "Querying work items...")

    # Phase 2: Concurrent batch processing
    if progress_callback:
        progress_callback("phase", f"Fetching {len(batches)} batches concurrently...")

    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent requests
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        # Submit all batch requests concurrently
        # Update progress as each batch completes

    # Phase 3: State history processing
    if progress_callback:
        progress_callback("phase", "Processing state transitions...")
```

**CLI Integration**:
- Update `fetch` command to use new progress callback system
- Show detailed progress with Rich progress bars
- Display phase transitions and completion estimates

**Expected Performance Improvements**:
- 3-5x faster execution through concurrent requests
- Clear progress indication prevents user confusion
- Better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Reduced terminal noise while maintaining visibility

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing functionality preserved
- Significant performance improvement (target: 50%+ faster)
- Clear progress indication throughout process
- No increase in API errors or failures
- User can see if process is progressing normally

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/azure_devops_client.py`: Core performance improvements
- `src/cli.py`: Progress callback integration
- Add concurrent request handling with proper error management

**Testing Requirements**:
- Validate with both small and large datasets
- Test API rate limiting and error scenarios
- Verify progress indication accuracy
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Completed Tasks

### TASK_001: Multi-Agent Development Environment Setup
**Agent**: architect
**Status**: completed
**Completed**: 2025-07-10

### TASK_002: Dashboard Integration & Real-time Updates
**Agent**: developer
**Status**: completed
**Completed**: 2025-07-10

## Agent Status Updates

### Developer Agent - 2025-07-11 01:00:00
**Current Task**: TASK_003 - Azure DevOps Performance Optimization
**Progress**: 0% - Task analysis complete, ready to implement
**Next Action**: Begin implementation of concurrent batch processing
**Blockers**: None
**Handoffs**: Will coordinate with QA agent for testing phase

---

## Coordination Notes

- **Emergency Stop**: Use "STOP_POLLING" command to halt all agents
- **Quality Gates**: All code changes must pass tests and linting
- **Priority**: Performance improvements are high priority due to user feedback
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies for this optimization

---

**Multi-Agent Protocol**: Agents must check this file every 30 seconds and update status after each task completion.
